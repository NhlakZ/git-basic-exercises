I wish to do my best in learning how to use Git to do my projects.
This file will keep all the changes I do on my git-basic-exercises repo where I
 will be learning how to commit, edit file to my master branch.
I have created a branch called milkshake-flavours where I included all my 
favourite flavours of milkshakes that I bought on file called milkshake.md.
I also created a branch called history where I created history.txt that will
display all the previously executed commands in my terminal and keep them as
a record for later use or sharing.
